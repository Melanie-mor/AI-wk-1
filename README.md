Week1 AI Assignment
My chat bot's name is called CryptoBuddy. It has a friendly welcoming tone.
I used python language, and jupyter notebook to run the code. The bot's database was provided.

Write a 50-word summary: “How does this chatbot mimic basic AI decision-making?”
CryptoBuddy chatbot mimics basic AI decision-making by using if-else rules to analyse crypto data. It responds to user questions with advice based on predefined trends and scores. Though simple, it acts like AI by making choices and giving suggestions using logic, data patterns, and basic understanding of user intent.

Below are images ( screenshots) of me interacting with the bot. I used copilot studio to make an agent.
The bot is functional and interactive.
